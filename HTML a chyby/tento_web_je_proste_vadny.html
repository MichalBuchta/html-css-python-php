    <h1>A Modest Proposal</h1>
    <h2>FOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE IN IRELAND <br>
        FROM BEING A BURDEN TO THEIR PARENTS OR COUNTRY, <br>
        AND FOR MAKING THEM BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC</h2>
    <h3>by Jonathan Swift</h3>
    <p>IT IS A MELANCHOLY OBJECT to those who walk through this great town or
        travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabin doors,
        crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six
        children, all in rags and importuning every passenger for an alms. These
        mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are
        forced to employ all their time in strolling to beg sustenance for their
        helpless infants, who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of
        work, or leave their dear native country to fight for the Pretender in Spain,
        or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope
        will not be liable to the least objection.</p>
        I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in
        London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most
        delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked,
        or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a
        ragout.</p>
